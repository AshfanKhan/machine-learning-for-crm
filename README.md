# machine-learning-for-crm
**Overview**\
The project aims to improve the Customer Relationship Management by identifying the Customer Churn based on the model training using Telecom Customer Data.\
**Data Pre Processing**\
Identified missing and unique values, performed mapping to standardize the inputs, introduced new column by grouping to improve the model training and reduce computation, and removed unnecessary data such as customer_id for model training.\
**Classifiers used for Model Training**
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest

**Evalation**\
Confusion Matrix is used for the overall evaluation of the implemented models. Performance metrics including accuracy, precision and recall can also be measured through Confusion Matrix.\
Accuracy of Log Model: 80.95%\
Accuray of Decision Tree: 72.77%\
Accuracy of Random Forest: 79.74%
